ot
==

ot is a minimal operational-transformation library for colaborative editing.

It was extracted from my long abondoned https://github.com/mb0/lab project and modified to operate
on slices of unicode runes. The original code was based on
https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.js by Tim Baumann (MIT License).
